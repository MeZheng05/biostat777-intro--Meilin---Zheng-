# biostat840-intro--Meilin---Zheng-

my repository for my statistical programing class, 

Name of the project: Meilin Zheng (meilin-zheng)

Link to the website: https://mzheng26.quarto.pub/meilin-zheng/about.html


Technical details for how the website was created and/or deployed

I first linked my quarto project to my github account. Then, I created 3 qmd files, which is the home page (index.qmd), the about page (about.qmd), and the data analysis page (data_analysis.qmd). I used the .yml file to connect these three pages together. In the .yml file, I also set the project type to be website, and I added navigation buttons to my linkedin account and github account. Then, within each quarto file, I created content following the instructions. 

At the end, I created a .bib file, citing all the sources I used. I searched for the format that bibtex uses for citing sources. I added in-text citations and citations according to the instructions. The helpful sources I used is https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html and https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Biblatex_citation_styles. 

At last, I deployed using quarto pub. I authorized my github account on creating website on Quarto Pub, and I published it with name "meilin-zheng".
