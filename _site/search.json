Also, there might be a slightly negative association between latitude and housing value. Moreover, the housing value located in inland clearly has a lower value than housings which is close to or have an ocean/bay view.\n\n\n\n\nMore on Exploration of Associations\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data) + geom_line(aes(y = value, x = income),color = \"violet\") + facet_wrap(.~ocean, ncol=2) + labs(title = \"Value of House (in 10K) VS.

For example, neighborhood median housing income is highly associated with housing price. The higher the income, the higher the housing value. This is similar to the conclusion reported by Cohen (2017) that GDP largely influence the housing price. Ocean view is another important factor that influences the housing value in California. For houses that are close to the ocean view or have a bay/ocean view, the housing price is much higher ($768836 higher on average) than the houses in inland. Interestingly, age does not influence the housing price conditioning on the subgroup with income greater than 100K. These three factors are also statistically significant.\nThe data is from year 1990, so it might not be able to predict the current housing price well. However, it still serves as a purpose to inform people about what are the important factors that influence housing price.\n\n\n\nThe Fitted Regression Model (baseline: houses with/near ocean/bay view)\n\\[\\widehat{\\text{value}} = 5.5579 + 3.81423*income + 0.09789*\\text{age} - 7.68836*\\text{I}(\\text{ocean = inland})\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe functions being used in this analysis example is written below:\ndplyr: group_by(), summarise(), mutate(), filter(), is.na(), case_when().\ntidyr: drop_na().\nggplot2: geom_point(), geom_line(), geom_violin(), geom_histogram(), geom_smooth(), facet_wrap(), theme(), labs()…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCohen, Viktorija. 2017. “The Analysis of the Determinants of Housing Prices.” Independent Journal of Management & Production 8 (1): 49–63.\n\n\nLi, Xinshu. 2022. “Prediction and Analysis of Housing Price Based on the Generalized Linear Regression Model.” National Library of Medicine.\n\n\nPace, R Kelley, and Ronald Barry. 1997. “Sparse Spatial Autoregressions.” Statistics and Probability Letters 33 (3): 291–97.\n\n\nZhao, Zhichun. 2021. “Information Visualization.” 1990 California Housing price -- Information Visualization (prattsi.org)."
